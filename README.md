# GLIDE Performance Optimization Skill

Expert guidance for optimizing Valkey GLIDE clients across Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and PHP. This skill provides context-aware performance optimization feedback through AI development tools (Kiro, Claude, WindSurf, VS Code).

## Features

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Loads only relevant language-specific patterns, significantly reducing context usage
- **Multi-Language Support**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and PHP
- **Automatic Language Detection**: Detects language from file extensions, imports, and syntax
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides before/after code examples and configuration guidance
- **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Identifies common performance issues like per-request client creation, missing timeouts, sequential operations

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Using NPX (requires Node.js 16+)
npx skills add valkey-io/valkey-samples/skills/glide-performance
```

This automatically installs the skill to your AI tool's skills directory.

### Updating

```bash
# Update to latest version
npx skills update glide-performance
```

### Manual Installation (Git Clone)

```bash
# For Kiro:
git clone https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-samples ~/.kiro/skills/

# For Claude:
git clone https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-samples ~/.claude/skills/

# For VSCode (User Profile):
git clone https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-samples ~/.agents/skills/

# For WindSurf (Global):
git clone https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-samples ~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/
```

The skill will be available at `<skills-dir>/valkey-samples/skills/glide-performance/`.

### Prerequisites

- **Git** installed (for manual installation)
- **Node.js 16+** (if using npx skills command)
- **AI development tool** installed (Kiro, Claude Desktop, WindSurf, or VS Code with compatible extension)

### Verification

After installation, verify the skill is available by asking in your AI tool's chat interface:

```
"List available skills"
```

You should see "glide-performance" or "GLIDE Performance Optimization" in the list.

## Usage

### Basic Code Review

1. Open a file containing Valkey GLIDE client code (e.g., `userService.js`)
2. Request code review: "Review this code for Valkey performance issues"
3. The skill automatically:
   - Loads core principles and anti-patterns
   - Detects your programming language
   - Loads language-specific patterns on-demand
   - Provides targeted recommendations with code examples

### Example Prompts

**General Review**:
- "Review this code for Valkey performance issues"
- "Check for GLIDE anti-patterns in this file"
- "Optimize this Valkey client code"

**Specific Issues**:
- "Is this client configuration optimal?"
- "Should I use batching here?"
- "How can I reduce latency in this code?"
- "Review my error handling strategy"

**Migration Help**:
- "Help me migrate from node-redis to GLIDE"
- "Convert this redis-py code to use GLIDE"
- "What GLIDE features can improve this Jedis code?"

## What Gets Loaded

The skill uses progressive disclosure to minimize context usage:

### Always Loaded (Core)
- `SKILL.md` - Universal anti-patterns and optimization strategies (~200 lines)

### Loaded On-Demand (Language-Specific)
- `reference/nodejs-patterns.md` - Node.js/TypeScript patterns (loaded only for .js/.ts files)
- `reference/python-patterns.md` - Python patterns (loaded only for .py files)
- `reference/java-patterns.md` - Java patterns (loaded only for .java files)
- `reference/go-patterns.md` - Go patterns (loaded only for .go files)
- `reference/php-patterns.md` - PHP patterns (loaded only for .php files)

### Additional Resources (Loaded When Referenced)
- `assets/performance-checklist.md` - Quick reference checklist
- `assets/server-configuration-guide.md` - Valkey/ElastiCache infrastructure optimization
- `assets/config-templates/` - Production-ready configuration examples

**Context Efficiency**: Reviewing Node.js code loads only Node.js patterns. Python/Java/Go/PHP patterns remain unloaded, reducing the amount of context loaded into your AI tool.

## Common Anti-Patterns Detected

1. **Per-Request Client Creation** - Creating clients inside request handlers
2. **Missing Request Timeouts** - No timeout configuration
3. **Sequential Operations** - Not using batching or concurrency
4. **Blocking Commands on Shared Client** - BLPOP/BRPOP blocking other operations
5. **Large Batch Sizes** - Batches with >1000 operations
6. **Missing Error Handling** - No retry strategy or error handling

## Optimization Strategies Provided

1. **Batching** - Pipeline and transaction patterns
2. **Cluster-Aware Operations** - Hash tags for co-location
3. **AZ Affinity** - Cost optimization for read-heavy workloads
4. **Async/Concurrent Patterns** - Reducing wall-clock time
5. **Data Size Optimization** - Hash structures vs JSON strings
6. **Configuration Tuning** - Timeouts, retries, connection pools

## Performance Impact

Typical improvements when moving from anti-patterns to recommended patterns. Actual results vary significantly based on your infrastructure, network conditions, data sizes, and workload characteristics. Always benchmark in your specific environment.

| Optimization | Latency Impact | Throughput Impact | Complexity |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Connection Reuse | Eliminates connection overhead (typically 10-100ms per request) | Can increase throughput 10-100x | Low |
| Batching | Reduces N roundtrips to 1 (scales with network latency) | Scales linearly with batch size | Low-Medium |
| AZ Affinity | Reduces cross-AZ latency | Moderate increase for read-heavy workloads | Medium |
| Async Patterns | Reduces wall-clock time for independent operations | Scales with concurrency level | Medium |
| Cluster Hash Tags | Reduces cross-shard operations | Moderate increase for multi-key operations | Medium-High |

**Important**: These are general guidelines based on common scenarios. Your results will depend on factors including network topology, server configuration, operation types, and data sizes. Benchmark before and after optimization to measure actual impact.
